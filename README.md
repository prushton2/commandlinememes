# Terminal Memes
This is a project that uses beautiful soup and selenium to interact with imgflip and make memes from the terminal. I am not crazy.

## Building
I recommend using pyinstaller to make the build. Install python, pip, and then pyinstaller. Once that is installed, run makebuild in your terminal to make the build. The executable will appear in ./dist. Keep the executable inside its own folder, and run it from inside the folder.
